  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Ayomitope's picture" width="300" />
  
  <p>Hello! My name is <strong><em>Ayomitope Olufemi</em></strong>, and this is my very first website. I'm learning something new every day as I build this.</p>
  
  <p>My background was in History and International Studies, which I studied at the Federal University Oye Ekiti, Ekiti State. Transitioning from a non-tech background into the tech world has been both challenging and rewarding. This journey has fueled my determination to succeed and has shown me that with consistency, curiosity, and the right resources, anyone can break into tech and thrive.</p>
  
  <p>I have a strong passion for <strong>cloud security</strong> and have been actively researching and practicing with various cloud tools and services using <strong>Amazon Web Service (AWS)</strong>. My goal is to become a skilled cloud security engineer, and I'm excited about the learning journey ahead. Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, I hope to not only grow in my career but also support others who are navigating the world of <strong>cloud security</strong>. I'm committed to sharing my knowledge and helping build a safer and more secure cloud environment for everyone.</p>
